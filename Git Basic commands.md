# Welcome to Git! #

## Introduction##
Git is a popular version control system used to track changes in source code during software development. It is widely used by developers to collaborate on projects and manage code repositories efficiently.

This README provides an introduction to using Git on Linux, including installation instructions and common commands.

## Getting Started with GitHub ##
If you're new to GitHub, here are some basic steps to get started:

Create a GitHub Account: Sign up for a free GitHub account if you don't already have one. You can do this by visiting GitHub's website and following the sign-up instructions.

Set Up Git: Install Git on your local machine if you haven't already. Git is a version control system used to manage and track changes in your code. You can download Git from the official Git website, and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Create a Repository: A repository, or "repo" for short, is where your project's files and code will live. To create a new repository, click on the "New" button in the top-right corner of the GitHub homepage, then follow the prompts to set up your repository.

Clone a Repository: To work on an existing project, you'll need to clone its repository to your local machine. Navigate to the repository on GitHub, click on the "Code" button, and copy the repository's URL. Then, use the git clone command in your terminal to clone the repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Make Changes: Once you've cloned a repository to your local machine, you can make changes to the files in your project using your preferred code editor.

Add, Commit, and Push Changes: After making changes to your project, you'll need to stage and commit those changes to Git, and then push them to GitHub. Use the following commands:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Commit message"
git push
